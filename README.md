# PassMan
**PassMan** is a terminal password manager written in Python.

## How it works:
You interact with PassMan from the terminal, give it a password and it encrypts it with GPG and gets stored locally safely in your computer, you decrypt it with your GPG passphrase, simple enough right?

## To-Do:
- [ ] Improve 'init' command and handling IDs
- [ ] Implement 'generate' and 'list' command
- [ ] Prettify interface
- [ ] Error handling class
- [ ] Improve README.md
